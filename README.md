# Coda-Alqosh-Gambit
Canonize a Chess player, embody the nuance playstyle and tendencies of the player. 
---

# Overview:

The project aims to craft a chess engine that not only plays the game but does so emulating the style, tactics, and nuances of a beloved player who has passed. By analyzing games played by the individual, ResurrectChess seeks to create a digital doppelgÃ¤nger, capable of playing chess with all the quirks, strategies, and heart that characterized his approach to the game.

## High Level Architecture

Leveraging the strengths of both Scala and Python to create a machine learning-powered chess engine that replicates a specific player's style. The process begins with data ingestion, where chess game data is collected and preprocessed for analysis. This data serves as the foundation for the Style Analysis Module, implemented in Python due to its rich ecosystem of machine learning libraries. Within this module, data is analyzed to identify unique playing patterns and tactics, which are then used to train a machine learning model to mimic the player's style. The trained model is integrated with a Scala-based chess engine, chosen for its robustness and scalability. This integration requires interoperability between Python and Scala, managed through tools like Jep or GraalVM. The user interface, developed with Scala.js, provides a seamless way for users to interact with the AI. Deployment is handled using containerization and orchestration tools to ensure the application is scalable and accessible.

## Definitions

* Data Ingestion: The process of collecting, importing, and processing data for further data analysis or data storage. In this context, it involves collecting chess game data from external sources like chess.com and preparing it for analysis.
* Style Analysis Module: A component developed in Python that uses statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze chess game data. The goal is to identify distinct patterns, preferences, and strategies that characterize the player's unique style.
* Machine Learning Model: An algorithm trained on a dataset to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. Here, it's used to predict or replicate the specific chess style of the player.
* Scala-Chess Integration: The process of combining the machine learning model with a chess engine written in Scala. This involves ensuring that the Python model can interact with the Scala application, allowing the AI to make moves within the chess engine.
* Python-Scala Interoperability: The ability for Python and Scala code to interact within the same application. Achieved through tools like Jep (Java Embedded Python) or GraalVM, which allow Python scripts to be called from Scala/JVM applications.
* Scala.js: A Scala compiler that compiles Scala code to JavaScript, enabling Scala developers to write front-end web applications in Scala.
* Deployment: The process of making the application available for use. Involves packaging the application, possibly using Docker containers, and managing its deployment with orchestration tools like Kubernetes to ensure it can scale and handle user demand.
* Containerization: A lightweight, portable method of distributing applications by encapsulating them in containers, which include all necessary executables, binary code, libraries, and configuration files.
* Orchestration: The automated configuration, coordination, and management of computer systems and software. Kubernetes is a popular tool for orchestrating containers, handling tasks like deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Commonly used for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, etc.
* Jep (Java Embedded Python): A library that allows Python scripts to be run from Java. It is used to facilitate the interoperability between Python and Java (and by extension, Scala) code within the same application.
* GraalVM: A universal virtual machine for running applications written in JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and JVM-based languages like Java and Scala. It supports interoperability between these languages, making it suitable for integrating Python machine learning models with Scala applications.
